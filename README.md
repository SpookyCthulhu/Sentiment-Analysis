Project goal:
In this repository I'm aiming to successfully perform sentiment analysis on at least 10000 AI related posts to determine the general publics attitude towards AI.
STEPS:
1. sucessfully run a model capable of doing sentiment analysis to determine the posters attitude towards AI or particular models in a scalable way.
2. Retrieve a large set of user data regarding AI on social media, hopefully at least 10000 data points large. (could require identification)
3. Run sentiment analysis on this dataset and then perform necessary visualization, analysis, and explanation of your findings.

After some trouble shooting I managed to get pytorch setup and ran a test of the transformer model I found on hugging tree.

Ran some tests this morning and realized that this transformer model couldn't come close to the performance of LLM's for sentiment analysis, so I'll be changing
My approach to NLP.
